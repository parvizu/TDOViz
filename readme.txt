The Discipline of Organizing

****** Overview ******
This visualization is meant to provide a better understanding of how notes are distributed and classified within the book "The Discipline of Organizing". It still is under development hence there are some bugs and issues that still need to be worked. The goal is to have it embedded as part of the eBook version.

****** METRICS *******
So far the only metric we are using is the number of notes. This metric is analyzed in two different scenarios or breakdown: by discipline and by chapter. 

- By Discipline, shows the distribution of the notes in the book by discipline, percentage-wise. If a discipline is selected, a graph will show how the notes for that discipline are distributed in the different chapters of the book.

- By Chapter, shows the composition of a particular chapter in terms of notes by disciplines.
